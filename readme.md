NavneetHub – Buy & Sell Used Navneet Books in Your Area


About the Project
NavneetHub is a platform for students (Standard 1–12) to buy affordable used Navneet books or sell their completed ones, helping others save money and reduce waste.

Tagline: Connect with students in your area to buy affordable used Navneet books or sell your completed ones. Save money, help others!

Problem
In many areas, students buy expensive Navneet books every year, but after exams, they are often left unused. Some students want to sell them, while others wish to buy second-hand copies at a lower price. Currently, there’s no organized platform for this exchange.

Solution
NavneetHub connects buyers and sellers directly, with verification, filters, and secure contact features.
